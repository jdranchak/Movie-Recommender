# Movie-Recommender

This repository contains the implementation of a collaborative filtering–based recommender system for movies. You will find:

Recommender Helper.py – Core classes:

An abstract Entity parent for User and Movie.

A Recommender base class handling bidirectional rating lookups.

Two subclasses:

UserToUserRecommender (user‑based CF)

ItemToItemRecommender (item‑based CF)

Interative Recommender.py – An interactive command‑line interface that loads real MovieLens data and prompts for recommendations.
